# ligh-dark-mode
Ligh &amp; Dark Mode web page creation with JavaScript

https://shawshanck.github.io/ligh-dark-mode/

* Dark and Light Mode template.
* JavaScript to control on changing theme, elements and colors.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* Using fontawsome icons and library.
* Creating a color library on CSS for different theme (dark or light)
* Using JavaScript to make function to change theme and also call CSS to load different colors or classes.
* I created 2 different functions on JS, one for light mode and another one for dark mode.
* Enabling local storage in order to save users preferred theme for their next visits.


I am learning from others and practicing projects to improve my skills and also sharing my experiences with people. I will study and learn more with encouragement I get from you.

If you want to share your experiences, feel free to contact.
