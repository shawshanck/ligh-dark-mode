* Dark and Light Mode template.
* JavaScript to control on changing theme, elements and colors.

Skills that I learned by doing this project:

* Using fontawsome icons and library.
* Creating a color library on CSS for different theme (dark or light)
* Using JavaScript to make function to change theme and also call CSS to load different colors or classes.
* I created 2 different functions on JS, one for light mode and another one for dark mode.
* Enabling local storage in order to save users preferred theme for their next visits.
